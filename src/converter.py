# The statement `from docx import Document` is importing the `Document` class from the `docx` module.
# This module allows you to work with Microsoft Word (.docx) files in Python. By importing the
# `Document` class, you can create, read, and manipulate Word documents programmatically using Python
# code. This can include tasks such as creating new documents, modifying existing documents,
# extracting text, formatting, adding tables, images, and more.
from docx import Document
# `from fpdf import FPDF` is a Python statement that imports the `FPDF` class from the `fpdf` module.
# FPDF is a popular library for creating PDF documents in Python. By importing the `FPDF` class, you
# can utilize its functionality to generate PDF files programmatically. This includes tasks such as
# adding text, images, and shapes to the PDF, setting fonts and styles, creating multi-page documents,
# and more. It provides a convenient way to create custom PDF documents from within your Python code.
from fpdf import FPDF
